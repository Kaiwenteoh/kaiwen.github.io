    <h1><u>Background</u></h1>

<p><i>Majikunaki</i> is a undergraduate project which is aimed to help non-technical users
      in the process of data visualization. Two web-based applications are proposed in this project 
      and named as <b>App I</b> and <b>App II</b>. Both tools are made with <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/" target="_blank"><i>shiny</i></a> and implement R data visualization package,  
      <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank"><i>ggplot2</i></a>.
      <br /> <br />
      An overview of the whole project can be found <a href="https://kaiwenteoh.github.io/majikunaki/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h1><u>Introduction</u></h1>

<p> Both applications allow users to take different approaches in visualizing imported data.	
	The first developed tool (I call it <b>App I</b>) recommends users chart type based on how they answer 
	the designed questions. The questions are generated based on the type of variable(s) they have selected in the beginning.
	In the end, a suitable chart type will be suggested and plotted for them automatically.
	<br /> <br />
	An example of this application can be found <a href="https://majikunaki.shinyapps.io/app1/" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<br /> 

<p> Another developed application is <b>App II</b>. <b>App II</b> provides a graphical user interface for non-technical users
	in using <i>ggplot2</i> package. The chart customization power for this tool is the extend of the first developed tool. 
	Different from <b>App I</b>, this tool allows users to pick a chart type and cuztomize the generated graphic directly.
